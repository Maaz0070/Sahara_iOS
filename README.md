## Web Scraping Code Snippet

Below is a snippet of the Swift code used to scrape data from local store websites using the SwiftSoup library:

```swift
func doAthing(_ searchBar: UISearchBar) {
    // ... Loading indicator setup ...

    let html = try String(contentsOf: URL(string: "https://www.locally.com/search/all/activities/depts?q=" + searchBar.text!)!)

    // ... Extracting elements from the HTML ...

    for title: Element in titles.array() {
        // ... Extracting product details ...

        // Fetch additional data from the product's individual page
        let html1 = try String(contentsOf: url)
        // ... Extracting distances, categories, descriptions, ratings, and more ...

        // Fetch store details page
        let html2 = try String(contentsOf: urls)
        // ... Extracting store phone numbers ...

        // Append extracted data to respective arrays
        products.append(try! title.attr("data-product-name"))
        // ... Append other data ...
    }

    // Dismiss loading indicator
    self.dismiss(animated: false, completion: nil)
}
