## Web Scraping Code Snippet

Below is a snippet of the Swift code used to scrape data from local store websites using the SwiftSoup library:

```swift
func doAthing(_ searchBar: UISearchBar) {
    // Set up an alert with a loading indicator
    let alert = UIAlertController(title: nil, message: "Please wait...", preferredStyle: .alert)
    let loadingIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(frame: CGRect(x: 10, y: 5, width: 50, height: 50))
    loadingIndicator.hidesWhenStopped = true
    loadingIndicator.style = UIActivityIndicatorView.Style.medium
    loadingIndicator.startAnimating()
    alert.view.addSubview(loadingIndicator)
    present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)

    // Construct the URL based on the search text
    guard let searchText = searchBar.text, let url = URL(string: "https://www.locally.com/search/all/activities/depts?q=" + searchText) else {
        return
    }

    do {
        // Fetch the HTML content from the URL
        let html = try String(contentsOf: url)
        let doc = try SwiftSoup.parse(html)

        // Extract elements from the HTML
        guard let titles = try? doc.getElementsByClass("product-thumb "),
              let prices = try? doc.getElementsByClass("product-thumb-price dl-price"),
              let stores = try? doc.getElementsByClass("filter-label-link"),
              let images = try? doc.getElementsByClass("product-thumb-img") else {
            return
        }

        // Clear existing arrays before populating with new data
        products = []
        miles = []
        dollars = []
        names = []
        images = []
        stars = []

        // Iterate through product elements and extract details
        for title in titles.array() {
            // ... Extract product details ...

            // Check if product URL can be constructed from href
            if let href = try? title.attr("href"), let productURL = URL(string: "https://www.locally.com/" + href) {
                // Fetch additional data from the product's individual page
                let html1 = try String(contentsOf: productURL)
                // ... Extract distances, categories, descriptions, ratings, and more ...

                // Append extracted data to respective arrays
                products.append(productName)
                miles.append(distance)
                // ... Append other data ...
            }
        }

        // Dismiss the loading indicator
        alert.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    } catch {
        // Handle errors here
        print("Error: \(error)")
        alert.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
